# Two Sum(Easy)

## Problem Statement

    Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

    You can return the answer in any order.

    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
        Output: [0,1]
        Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
        Output: [1,2]

    Example 3:
        Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
        Output: [0,1]

    Constraints:
        * 2 <= nums.length <= 104
        * -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
        * -109 <= target <= 109
        * Only one valid answer exists.

## Solutions

### Brute Approach

#### Logic
    - Loop through each number in the array.
    - For each number, check every other number (after the current one) to see if the sum of the two numbers equals the target.
    - If you find such a pair, return their indices.

#### Implementation (C++)
    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
            // Step 1: Get the size of the input vector 'nums'.
            int n = nums.size();
            
            // Step 2: Iterate through each number in the array using index 'i'.
            for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                
                // Step 3: For each number 'nums[i]', iterate through the remaining numbers
                // (those after 'i') using index 'j'.
                for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                    
                    // Step 4: Check if the sum of the two numbers (nums[i] + nums[j]) equals the target.
                    if(nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                        
                        // Step 5: If a pair is found that sums to the target, return their indices {i, j}.
                        return {i, j};
                    }
                }
            }
            
            // Step 6: If no pair that sums to the target is found, return {-1, -1}.
            // This case should not occur in problems where a solution is guaranteed.
            return {-1, -1};
        }
    };

#### Explaination
    - We use two loops:
        - The first loop (i) picks each number in the array.
        - The second loop (j) picks the other numbers after the current number (i).
    - If the sum of nums[i] and nums[j] equals the target, we return their indices {i, j}.
    - Since each pair is checked, this approach will always find the correct answer (if one exists).
    - If no answer is found, we return {0, 0}, but this will never happen, as the problem guarantees that an answer always exists.

#### Time & Space Complexities
    Time Complexity: O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the input vector `nums`.
    This is because there are two nested loops: the outer loop runs n times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs up to n-1 times in the worst case. Therefore, the total number of iterations is proportional to n * (n - 1) / 2, which simplifies to O(n^2).

    Space Complexity: O(1)
    The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables like `i` and `j`. The output is a vector of size 2, which does not depend on the size of the input, so it can also be considered O(1) in terms of additional space used.

### Optimal Approach : Hash Table

#### Logic
    - We use a hash map (unordered_map) to store previously encountered numbers and their indices as we iterate through the array.
    - For each number, we check if the complement (i.e., target - nums[i]) is already in the hash map.
    - If the complement is found in the map, that means we've already seen a number that, together with the current number, sums up to the target. In that case, we return their indices.
    - If the complement is not found, we store the current number and its index in the map.
    
The algorithm ensures that we only need one pass through the array, making it more efficient than the previous brute-force approach.

#### Implementation (C++)
    class Solution {
    public:
        vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
            // Step 1: Create a hash map to store numbers and their corresponding indices.
            unordered_map<int, int> mp;
            
            // Step 2: Iterate through the array.
            for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
                // Step 3: Check if the complement of the current number exists in the map.
                if (mp.find(target - nums[i]) != mp.end()) {
                    // If the complement is found, return the indices of the complement and the current number.
                    return {mp[target - nums[i]], i};
                }
                // Step 4: If complement is not found, store the current number and its index in the map.
                else {
                    mp[nums[i]] = i;
                }
            }

            // Step 5: If no valid pair is found (this should not happen as per the problem description), return {0, 0}.
            return {0, 0}; 
        }
    };

#### Explaination
    - We initialize an unordered map (mp) to store each number and its index as we iterate through the array.
    - For each number nums[i]:
        - We check if the complement (i.e., target - nums[i]) is already in the map.
        - If it's found, it means we've already seen a number earlier in the array that, when added to nums[i], equals the target. In that case, we return the indices of the complement and the current number.
        - If the complement isn't found, we store the current number and its index in the map.
    - If no valid pair is found, the function returns {0, 0} (though this case won't happen as the problem guarantees that there is always exactly one solution).

#### Time & Space Complexities
    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector nums.
    We are iterating through the array only once. For each element, checking if the complement exists in the map takes constant time on average (O(1)) due to the properties of hash maps.

    Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input vector nums.
    In the worst case, we need to store all n elements in the hash map, which results in O(n) space complexity.
